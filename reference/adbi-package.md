# adbi: 'DBI' Compliant Database Access Using 'ADBC'

In order to make Arrow Database Connectivity ('ADBC'
<https://arrow.apache.org/adbc/>) accessible from R, an interface
compliant with the 'DBI' package is provided, using driver back-ends
that are implemented in the 'adbcdrivermanager' framework. This enables
interacting with database systems using the Arrow data format, thereby
offering an efficient alternative to 'ODBC' for analytical applications.
