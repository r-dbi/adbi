<!-- badges: end -->

Bringing [arrow-adbc](https://github.com/apache/arrow-adbc) to R via [DBI](https://github.com/r-dbi), adbi aims to provide DBI-compliant database access.

## Installation

Install the latest release of adbi from CRAN with the following code:

```r
install.packages("adbi")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install the development version of adbi from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-dbi/adbi")
```

## Example

The `data.frame` API of DBI is supported.

```{r df}
# To run this example, please install the adbcsqlite package first.
# 
# install.packages("adbcsqlite")

library(DBI)

# Create an SQLite connection using the adbcsqlite backend
con <- dbConnect(adbi::adbi("adbcsqlite"), uri = ":memory:")

# Write a table
dbWriteTable(con, "swiss", datasets::swiss)

# Query it
dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT * from swiss WHERE Agriculture < 40")

# Prepared statements
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * from swiss WHERE Agriculture < ?")

dbBind(res, 30)
dbFetch(res)

dbBind(res, 20)
dbFetch(res)

# Cleanup
dbClearResult(res)
```

More interestingly, the recent arrow-extension API of DBI is supported as well.

```{r arrow}
# Queries
dbGetQueryArrow(con, "SELECT * from swiss WHERE Agriculture < 40")

# Prepared statements
res <- dbSendQueryArrow(con, "SELECT * from swiss WHERE Agriculture < ?")

dbBind(res, 30)

ret <- dbFetchArrow(res)
ret$length

dbBind(res, 20)

# Chunked fetches
while (!dbHasCompleted(res)) {
  ret <- dbFetchArrowChunk(res)
  message("fetched ", ret$length, " rows")
}

# Cleanup
dbClearResult(res)
dbDisconnect(con)
```
